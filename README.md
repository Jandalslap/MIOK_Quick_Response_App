This App was designed by the Kaitiaki Group of students from WINTEC City Campus for the COMP709 Mobile Application Development Module.

Our Client was AWAI of Massey University and we were tasked with providing two mobile app solutions. 

The first for the saftey of children in the home at risk of domestic violence. The second, an information app for parents and caregivers for the removal or placement of at risk youth in their care.

The First Solution: MIOK Quick Response App
The MIOK Quick Response App is the first solution developed under this initiative. It is designed to address the safety needs of children in high-risk home environments by offering features that enable quick and efficient responses. The app serves as a practical tool to:

Provide children with immediate access to help or resources.
Offer caregivers and support personnel clear, actionable information.
Enhance overall safety measures through technology-driven solutions.

This app exemplifies the commitment of the Kaitiaki Group to creating impactful digital tools that contribute to community safety and well-being.
